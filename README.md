# Lung-Cancer-Linear-Regression-Model
Lung cancer mortality rate associated with socioeconomic status for low income segment
We have been employed as data scientists by a consulting company whose aim is to find associative and consequential factors of low income group population through effective analysis from past open data. 
We've been asked to examine whether low income groups are at greater risk for being diagnosed and dying from cancer. If successful, our analysis will help the nonprofit with lobbying and fundraising.

# Strategy
We will be using open data. The data has been published through open data network for research that fits our present needs -- for example, cancer.gov for cancer incidence and mortality data, and the Census American Community Survey for a multitude of additional variables we may choose to include in our model.

# Our broad goals:
1) Demonstrate whether or not cancer incidence and mortality are correlated with socioeconomic status.
2) Provide both quantitative and visual evidence that the nonprofit can take and use to further their mission.

# Objectives:
a) Gather, Clean and prepare data
b) Exploratory analysis
c) Statistical model
d) Visualizations
